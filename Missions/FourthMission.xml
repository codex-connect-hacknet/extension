    <body>That was amazing, i never thought that you could do these things so easily, your skills are amazing, and you can do so much with that.
I present you with an invitation to a private team called Codex Connect, they only get the best people to do tasks. But before going in, you must create a pull request in our GitHub repository.
You must store your name on variable in precodex.sh and show your name in terminal
I will send you a note on how to do it.
Good luck!
