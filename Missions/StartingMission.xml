    <subject>Get your tools</subject>
    <body>As you should know, getting your tools is the fundamental thing to start working on. Go grab some tools that you must need in a server.
The thing is, I don't know exactly what the ssh password of it is or its IP. I will send you as an attachment a small virtual private server that is related to the server.
You have to figure it out yourself. Good luck!
