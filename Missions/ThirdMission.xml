    <body>Did you really get the database password so quickly? It must be easy for you, no? As i know, in the database connection file, you got the ip address of where the database is located.
Ok, so change the data from a guy called "Mike Mentzer" and change the month_value to "0". I think I don't need to say this to you, but just in case, use the replace command to change the content of a file. I suppose they store the data in json format.
Thanks.
