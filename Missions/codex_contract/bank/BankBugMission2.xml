    <subject>Bank.NET Bug(1)</subject>
    <body>Not going to lie, it's rare to see someone obtaining database connection information so easily.

We found a dark web forum discussing a vulnerability that allows them to exploit the system to withdraw any amount of money they want. They mentioned it's a frontend problem where they can manipulate the input of the withdrawal amount, enabling them to withdraw more money than their account holds.

I will send you an attachment related to the bank net server. There is also a GitHub repository that addresses various issues. Please help me find the issue related to input manipulation and modify the code using the replace command to fix the vulnerability.
Best regards,
