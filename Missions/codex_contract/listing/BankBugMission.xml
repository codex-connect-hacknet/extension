    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#!
There is a vulnerability in bank plataform Bank.NET and we want you to fix it.
Please, try to discover and fix it. By the way, i almost forgot, before you actually fix it, can you please upload the database connection of Bank.NET in our dedicated upload files and reply me when you have done it? Thanks!.

Best regards,
