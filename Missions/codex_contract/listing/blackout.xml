    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#!
As part of our critical mission to dismantle a dangerous network involved in criminal activities, we need to take immediate and comprehensive action to eliminate all traces of this network. Additionally, I need you to upload a text file called "ADDRESS_BLACKOUT.TXT" that is located somewhere on that network, it contains the address of the main server of the network. This should be a simple task for you.

Best regards,
Codex Connect Hub Services
