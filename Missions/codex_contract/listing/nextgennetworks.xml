    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#!
The objective is to locate and retrieve a file named database.sqlite. This file is critical to our operations, and its recovery is of the utmost importance.
Conduct a thorough search across all our systems, servers, and backup locations for any tips to get that file.
According to an Itallian ex-worker Callisto Antonello of NextGen Networks, this file might be hidden deep within our systems. We need to be thorough in our search and leave no stone unturned.
Best regards,
Codex Connect Hub Services
