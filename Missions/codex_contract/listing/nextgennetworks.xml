    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#!
The objective is to locate and retrieve a file named database.sqlite. This file is critical to our operations, and its recovery is of the utmost importance.
Conduct a thorough search across all our systems, servers, and backup locations for any tips to get that file.
According to an Itallian ex-worker Callisto Antonello of NextGen Networks, this file might be hidden deep within our systems. Please upload database.sqlite.
Best regards,
Codex Connect Hub Services
