Hey, Alexei. I don't have a database connection because the file is encrypted.

Anyway, you can get that file if you can decrypt it.

Here is the IP address where the file is located: 160.233.49.119
As you already have an account, your username should be literally alexei and password smirnov.
Have a nice day!
